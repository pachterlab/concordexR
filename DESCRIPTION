Description: Spatial homogeneous regions (SHRs) in tissues are domains
    that are homogenous with respect to cell type composition. We present
    a method for identifying SHRs using spatial transcriptomics data, and
    demonstrate that it is efficient and effective at finding SHRs for a
    wide variety of tissue types.  concordex relies on analysis of
    k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graphs. The tool is also useful for analysis
    of non-spatial transcriptomics data, and can elucidate the extent of
    concordance between partitions of cells derived from clustering
    algorithms, and transcriptomic similarity as represented in kNN
    graphs.
