The goal of concordexR is to identify spatial homogeneous regions (SHRs) as 
defined in the recent manuscript, ["Identification of spatial homogenous regions in tissues with concordex"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.28.546949). Briefly, SHRs are are 
domains that are homogeneous with respect to cell type composition. `concordex` 
relies on the the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph to representing similarities 
between cells and uses common clustering algorithms to identify SHRs.

## Installation

Versions of the `concordexR` package that do not enable clustering spatial data
into spatial homogeneous regions (SHRs) are available for Bioconductor versions
3.17-19. The most recent version of the package is slated to be released on 
Bioconductor version 3.20. 

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    
BiocManager::install(version="3.20")
BiocManager::install("concordexR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example using concordex:

```{r load libraries}
library(SFEData)
library(Voyager)
library(scran)
library(bluster)

library(concordexR)
```

```{r}
sfe <- McKellarMuscleData("small")
clusters <- quickCluster(sfe, min.size=2, d=15)
```

```{r example}
nbc <- calculateConcordex(
    sfe,
    clusters,
    n_neighbors=10,
    BLUSPARAM=KmeansParam(2)
)

colData(sfe)[["shr"]] <- attr(nbc, "shrs")
```

```{r plot-shr}
plotSpatialFeature(sfe, features="shr")
```
